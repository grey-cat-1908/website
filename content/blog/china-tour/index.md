Nihao! Hello from China!

As you might have guessed from the greeting, I'm in China. However... That's not true anymore. I started writing this post on the train to Shanghai, and I am finishing it in Moscow. Or rather, I have already finished writing it.


I travelled to Beijing in late 2023. It's worth noting that Beijing airport is very large, with signs in both Chinese and English.   

Interestingly, the development on the outskirts of Beijing is reminiscent of Soviet architecture, but with taller buildings. The central area of Beijing is characterised by European-style architecture, but also reflects local culture.

The climate in Beijing is terrible, with high humidity levels leading to cold winters and stifling summers. Additionally, the air quality is heavily impacted by pollution. It is said that winning a car licence plate (blue) in Beijing is nearly impossible, according to locals. It is possible to obtain green licence plates for electric cars in Beijing, despite the city not being as wealthy as many other Chinese cities. The northern regions of China are generally considered to be poorer than the southern regions. Property prices are high but average wages remain low. Beijing boasts numerous historical sights. Regrettably, I cannot provide pictures of them as they are of poor quality. Therefore, I will not describe them either.

One of the most fascinating attractions is the Great Wall of China. I believe the view would be more pleasant during a different season.

Afterwards, I took the train to Shanghai. Chinese train stations are impressive.   

The train from Beijing to Shanghai averages about 345 kilometres per hour.

Upon arrival in Shanghai, I tried сandied hawberries, which were certainly very tasty. Shanghai is undoubtedly wealthier than Beijing. I enjoyed the stunning beauty of Shanghai, but I found the air quality lacking. The already stunning views are enhanced by the city's location on a river. Shanghai is primarily a business hub, characterized by towering skyscrapers. In fact, it is home to one of the world's tallest buildings, currently ranked third in height (previously second).

I visited the zoo and was amazed by the variety of animals. The zoo is quite expansive. Panda!!!

During my trip to Shanghai, I had several tasks to complete. Although I won't go into detail about them. Instead, I will share my opinions and facts about China.

I did learn a few new Chinese characters. Specifically, I learned that 入口 means entrance, 出口 means exit, and 口 means mouth.   

I discovered that in China, many websites and online services are blocked. To access the content, you need to use VPN. Additionally, you can use Yandex.Translator and local Baidu maps. It is unclear why local women publish their photos in the restaurant's images section.

Chinese communism is not truly communist, and in fact, the largest chineese banks are privately owned. Only the most suitable candidates are invited to the party, as there is a selection process. Some attendees may have religious beliefs, including Taoism, which involves praying to real people.

The cuisine here is unique. I recommend trying the dumplings, which were actually invented in this region. However, there are still plenty of delicious options to choose from. Raw fish is not commonly consumed and spicy dishes are rare. Rice can be eaten using chopsticks, and salted bamboo is a delectable delicacy.

I visited the official Huawei Store and was impressed by the wide range of products available, which far exceeded the selection in our local Huawei Store or in the UAE. Although half of the store was dedicated to electrocars, the store itself was a larger replica of the Apple Store across the street.  Buying a pink MateBook X Pro is not a good idea, especially if it comes with Windows 11 Chinese Edition.

Local McDonald's offers a variety of unique menu items such as taro pie, a wide selection of burgers, delicious fries, and milk. 

Military service is mandatory for citizens aged 18 to 22. University admission is determined by exam results, which are notoriously difficult. Chinese universities are highly regarded. It is worth noting that Chinese citizenship can be acquired through marriage to a Chinese citizen. If you are a nice young Chinese girl, please contact me via email. (Just kidding... contact me through my agent).

Overall, China is a fascinating country that I would definitely like to revisit. While I may not choose to return to Beijing, given the abundance of other captivating cities in China, I would certainly return to Shanghai. The cuisine is delectable and there are numerous sights to behold.
